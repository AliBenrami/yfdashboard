    "artical_content": "The 10 largest growth-focused U.S. companies now make up 38% of the S&P 500 . Known as the \" Ten Titans ,\" the list includes Nvidia ( NVDA -3.38% ) , Microsoft , Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Broadcom , Tesla , Oracle ( ORCL -5.97% ) , and Netflix ( NFLX -1.87% ) . Oracle, Netflix, and Nvidia have been the best performers of the Titans year to date. Let's determine if these growth stocks have what it takes to continue outperforming next year. Image source: Getty Images. Oracle has innovative ideas, but they come at a price Oracle has been the standout among the Titans. With a year-to-date total return of more than 40%, it vaulted its market cap above $660 billion. ORCL Total Return Level data by YCharts . Oracle was close to dead money in the five years between 2015 and the end of 2019 -- gaining just 17.8% compared to 56.9% for the S&P 500. But since the start of 2020, Oracle is up 345% compared to a 100.6% gain in the S&P 500. A big driver of the outperformance is the build-out and adoption of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Oracle transformed from a database-first company to a fully fledged ecosystem. Not long ago, companies were using Oracle's database software on third-party clouds. Oracle decided to capture that revenue by building out its own cloud services. Oracle Integration Cloud hosts software-as-a-service offerings for financial reporting, automated workflows, human resources operations, marketing, personalization, and more. Oracle also offers artificial intelligence (AI)-powered database services. And OCI has been shown to be much more cost-effective for data-intensive operations than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. It's an especially ideal offering for industries like financial services and healthcare that have complex regulatory frameworks and sensitive information. On its earnings calls, Oracle often discusses how industries are choosing OCI for its security and compliance capabilities. Oracle was already a leader in enterprise software solutions. And now, it is a major player in the cloud business. The main downside of Oracle is that its valuation is expensive, and it is spending extremely aggressively . Oracle is arguably among the higher-risk, higher-potential-reward Titans. If its investments translate to bottom-line earnings growth, it could continue to be one of the best performers in the group. If not, it wouldn't be surprising if the stock underwent a sizable sell-off. Netflix is an entertainment giant that is raking in the cash flow Netflix's outsized returns in recent years are partly due to how beaten down the stock was going into 2023. Netflix fell over 50% in 2022, outpacing the broader sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) that year. At the time, other streaming platforms were gaining traction, and Netflix was still inconsistently profitable. The business model has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. So it's not a transformational story like Oracle. Rather, Netflix has perfected its craft. The biggest change has been its content slate -- what it spends on, how it markets that content (like the global success of \"KPop Demon Hunters ,\") and basically just boosting its overall content success rate. The second major change was cracking down on password sharing. This was a resounding success because a lot of new accounts opened up -- showing that customers were willing to pay for Netflix because they value the service (again, despite a lot of competition). And finally, Netflix's ad-supported tier is driving new signups, which accelerates revenue growth. Netflix is an industry-leading cash cow with high margins. It has become a near-perfect business. The only issue is that the valuation reflects that, as Netflix trades at 52 times trailing 12-month earnings. Netflix could still be a winning long-term stock, but it may need a year or two to grow into its valuation. Therefore, it may not be a standout performer in 2026. Nvidia just delivered another blowout quarter Nvidia reported exceptional second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Aug. 27 despite the company's China business being hindered by export restrictions to China. Even with difficult comps from the second-quarter fiscal 2025, Nvidia grew revenue by 56% and adjusted earnings per share by 54%. Arguably, the most impressive aspect of Nvidia's results is that it continues to sustain ultra-high gross margins over 70%. Nvidia's high margins allow it to convert a substantial amount of sales into profit, which is a testament to its edge over the competition and technological leadership on the global stage. Nvidia gets a lot of attention for its data center business -- and rightfully so, as it made up 88% of revenue in the recent quarter. But it's worth noting that the rest of the business is doing well too. Nvidia's non-data center revenue, which includes gaming and AI PC professional visualization, automotive, and robotics, was collectively $5.49 billion -- up 48% compared to $3.7 billion a year ago. Nvidia is in its third year of what has been an uninterrupted masterclass of exponential growth on a scale unlike any business the world has ever seen. And somehow, the company still has its foot on the gas with no signs of slowing down. Nvidia's outlook for the third-quarter fiscal 2026 calls for $54 billion in revenue even if it ships zero H20 chips to China -- all while maintaining a 73% gross margin. That would mark a 54% increase in revenue and just slightly lower gross margins than third-quarter fiscal 2025 and a near three-fold increase in revenue in just two years. Despite the impeccable results, Nvidia's valuation isn't cheap, as investors are pricing in a sustained breakneck growth rate. But Nvidia just keeps delivering, so its 58.4 price-to-earnings ratio is reasonable. If Nvidia's stock price remained unchanged for a year but the company grew earnings by 50%, the P/E would drop to 38.9. So even now, with the stock on track to crush the S&P 500 for the third consecutive year, Nvidia remains a top AI stock to buy now . I expect Nvidia to continue leading the Ten Titans higher in 2026, especially if trade policy with China eases. However, if for whatever reason there's a slowdown in AI spending from key Nvidia customers, Nvidia could drag down the Ten Titans and the broader market with it.",

    "artical_content": "Big tech companies are set to spend $375 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure this year, according to estimates from analysts at UBS . That number will climb to $500 billion next year. The biggest expense item in building out AI data centers is semiconductors. Nvidia ( NVDA -3.38% ) has been by far the biggest beneficiary of that spend so far. Its GPUs offer best-in-class capabilities for general AI training and inference . Other AI accelerator chipmakers have also seen strong sales growth, including Broadcom ( AVGO -3.70% ) , which makes custom AI chips as well as networking chips, which ensure data moves efficiently from one server to another, keeping downtime to a minimum. Broadcom's stock price has increased more than fivefold since the start of 2023, and the company now sports a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Another year of spectacular growth could easily place it in the $2 trillion club. But another semiconductor stock looks like a more likely candidate to reach that vaunted level, joining Nvidia and the four other members of the club by 2028. Image source: Getty Images. Is Broadcom a $2 trillion company? Broadcom is a massive company with operations spanning hardware and software, but its AI chips business is currently steering the ship. To that end, AI revenue climbed 46% year over year last quarter to reach $4.4 billion. Management expects the current quarter to produce $5.1 billion in AI semiconductor revenue, accelerating growth to roughly 60%. AI-related revenue now accounts for roughly 30% of Broadcom's sales, and that's set to keep climbing over the next few years. Broadcom's acquisition of VMware last year is another growth driver. The software company is now fully integrated into Broadcom's larger operations, and it's seen strong success in upselling customers to the VMware Cloud Foundation, enabling enterprises to run their own private clouds. Over 87% of its customers have transitioned to the new subscription, resulting in double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue . But Broadcom shares are extremely expensive. The stock garners a forward P/E ratio of 45. While its AI chip sales are growing quickly and it's seeing strong margin improvement from VMware, it's important not to lose sight of how broad a company Broadcom is. Despite the stellar growth in those two businesses, the company is still only growing its top line at about 20% year over year. Investors should expect only incremental margin improvements going forward as it scales the AI accelerator business. That means the business is set up for strong earnings growth, but not enough to justify its 45 times earnings multiple. Another semiconductor stock trades at a much more reasonable multiple, and is growing just as fast. The semiconductor giant poised to join the $2 trillion club by 2028 Both Broadcom and Nvidia rely on another company to ensure they can create the most advanced semiconductors in the world for AI training and inference. That company is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM -3.05% ) , which actually prints and packages both companies' designs. Almost every company designing leading-edge chips relies on TSMC for its technological capabilities. As a result, its market share of semiconductor manufacturing has climbed to more than two-thirds. TSMC benefits from a virtuous cycle, ensuring it maintains and grows its massive market share. Its technology lead helps it win big contracts from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. That gives it the capital to invest in expanding capacity and research and development for its next-generation process. As a result, it maintains its technology lead while offering enough capacity to meet the growing demand for manufacturing. TSMC's leading-edge process node, dubbed N2, will reportedly charge a 66% premium per silicon wafer over the previous generation (N3). That's a much bigger step-up in price than it's historically managed, but the demand for the process is strong as companies are willing to spend whatever it takes to access the next bump in power and energy efficiency. While TSMC typically experiences a significant drop off in gross margin as it ramps up a new expensive node with lower initial yields, its current pricing should help it maintain its margins for years to come as it eventually transitions to an even more advanced process next year. Management expects AI-related revenue to average mid-40% growth per year from 2024 through 2029. While AI chips are still a relatively small part of TSMC's business, that should produce overall revenue growth of about 20% for the business. Its ability to maintain a strong gross margin as it ramps up the next two manufacturing processes should allow it to produce operating earnings growth exceeding that 20% mark. TSMC's stock trades at a much more reasonable earnings multiple of 24 times expectations. Considering the business could generate earnings growth in the low 20% range, that's a great price for the stock. If it can maintain that earnings multiple through 2028 while growing earnings at about 20% per year, the stock will be worth well over $2 trillion at that point.",

Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Business • 4 min read Why Wall Street has developed an unhealthy obsession with Nvidia Analysis by Allison Morrow PUBLISHED Aug 30, 2025, 11:00 AM ET Nvidia, on its own, accounts for 8% of the value of the S&P 500. VCG/AP/File Tech giants AI Corporate news Tech news See all topics Facebook Tweet Email Link Link Copied! Follow A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. New York — For markets, the most important story of the week was, somehow, not the president’s attempted firing of a top Federal Reserve official. Instead, it was Nvidia’s earnings report, a quarterly event that, in the financial world, has taken on Super Bowl-level enthusiasm. (Seriously, the company has fans who throw watch parties for the occasion, complete with Mardi Gras beads.) It’s not hard to see why folks are all fired up. If you’d invested $1,000 in Nvidia (NVDA) shares just two years ago, you’d be sitting on a $3,000 profit right now. The stock is up 30% this year, versus the S&P 500’s 10% gain. And quarter after quarter, Nvidia tends to blow past the consensus forecast on Wall Street. What’s not to love? Well, for some investors, at least, the market around Nvidia is starting to look awfully bubbly. And not just because Sam Altman, the CEO of one of Nvidia’s customers, has publicly speculated that AI was a bubble. Related article This may not be the AI winter. But investors are certainly feeling the chill. Kilito Chan/Moment RF/Getty Images The AI vibe shift is upon us Here are some of the reasons people are beginning to worry about the Nvidia story. Reason No. 1: Nvidia is huge. But not just, like, “Oh, it’s a big company!” It is bigger, in terms of market value, than any public company ever. We often toss around its market capitalization — $4 trillion — as if that number makes any sense. Consider that the world had never seen a $1 trillion public company until Apple crossed the threshold in 2018. Now we have nearly a dozen, almost all of them in the American tech sector. Reason No. 1(a): That size makes Nvidia (pronounced in-vid-ee-uh) on its own account for 8% of the S&P 500. So, even if you don’t hold Nvidia shares, you gotta watch its results because they could swing the entire market. Zoom out even further: Nvidia’s market cap accounts for 3.6% of global GDP, according to Deutsche Bank. Yes. One single company, which gets half its revenue from just three customers, is that huge. Reason No. 2: When we talk about the AI industry, we’re mostly talking about Nvidia. If you use ChatGPT, that’s powered by Nvidia chips. The same goes for Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, Amazon’s…whatever Amazon’s chatbot is called — all of those products are powered by the processors made by this company that up until a few years ago was just a tech workhorse churning out processors that make video games look cooler. (You may be thinking, Hey, Nvidia sounds kinda like a monopoly, to which I say, Please do not use the m-word around here, or else I’ll have to call the lawyers. Let’s just say Nvidia almost exclusively controls the supply of vital resources to an entire industry and enjoys monopoly-esque profit margins.) So, if you follow the Gospel of AI and believe that the technology has the power to dismantle the entire global economy, Nvidia is your clear picks-and-shovels play. But — and here’s why the focus on Nvidia is getting even more intense — what if the technology Nvidia is powering turns out to be, I dunno, not quite the revolution that your Sams Altman or Darios Amodei have promised? What happens to the picks and shovels when the gold rush goes bust? Last week, I wrote that the AI vibe shift was underway, nearly three years after ChatGPT’s public debut set off a frenzy of investment and a nauseating amount of corporate pablum about how AI is going to change everything. A rash of bad AI headlines, combined with signs of a weakening economy, has rattled investors, sparking a tech sell-off last week and a lot of nail-biting ahead of Nvidia’s earnings. To be fair, AI chatbots like ChatGPT have changed a lot — like how much we talk about AI, and it has seriously increased the use of the word “trillion” in the financial media. Chatbots have also been accused of pushing multiple people to suicide and fueling delusional spirals that ruin lives. Related article Adam Raine is seen in this photo provided by the family. Courtesy Raine Family Parents of 16-year-old sue OpenAI, claiming ChatGPT advised on his suicide What AI hasn’t done is demonstrate a single use case that would even come close to justifying the hundreds of billions of dollars companies are pouring into it. The frenzy isn’t limited to speculative delusions on Wall Street. There is actually so much real money behind the AI race that capital expenditures from American tech giants have contributed more to GDP growth this year than consumer spending has, according to Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research. I’m going to repeat that, because it’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever read: AI-related capex has contributed more to US economic growth this year than consumer spending. Consumer spending! That’s the engine of the economy — some 70% of our GDP. That’s just an insane concentration of capital to build infrastructure for what could end up being just another vial of Silicon Valley snake oil. “Ultimately, investment only makes sense insofar as it raises productivity and real wages and consumer spending,” Dutta said in a podcast. “That’s not yet happening.” Tech giants AI Corporate news Tech news See all topics Facebook Tweet Email Link Link Copied!

    "artical_content": "With a nearly $4.5 trillion market cap, Nvidia ( NVDA -3.38% ) is the largest company in the world, and it has generated substantial returns for shareholders. Viewed as the ultimate pick-and-shovel play powering the artificial intelligence wave , the company makes semiconductor chips that are designed to process multiple tasks simultaneously, making them ideal for AI. Nvidia recently reported another round of strong earnings for its fiscal 2026 second quarter. The adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 and revenue of $46.74 billion both beat the Wall Street consensus. However, investors seemed disappointed that the company slightly missed revenue estimates in its data center division, although management indicated it is still seeing strong AI infrastructure demand. Image source: Getty Images. If you invested $10,000 in Nvidia a decade ago, here's how much you would have now Betting on your vision of the future is the name of the game when it comes to investing in the stock market. Very few managed to see the potential of Nvidia and its graphics processing units to disrupt AI back in 2015. But those who were bullish on the company's prospects in the gaming or automotive industries have made a killing. In just 10 years, the stock is up about 33,280%, meaning if you invested $10,000 back then, you'd be a multimillionaire today. Data by YCharts . As you can see, Nvidia stock really took off in 2023 and hasn't looked back since. Consider that if you had invested in the benchmark S&P 500 index a decade ago, your $10,000 would be worth about $33,400. That's a very strong return for the broad market, but it still pales in comparison to the chip giant's performance. Nvidia trades around 41 times forward earnings as of this writing. There's obviously debate over whether the company is overvalued, especially if the AI boom eventually slows down. But there are also plenty of stocks in the market that trade at much higher multiples with less growth, so investors are happy to pay the premium.",
