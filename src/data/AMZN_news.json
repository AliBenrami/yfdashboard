(NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was focused on. Cramer was bullish on the company during the episode and said: “I’m simply trying to put a valuation on a company that makes what you need to become one of the serious players in AI. I learned not to question Amazon or Microsoft or Google or Meta, or even Tesla, the big customers, a long time ago. They know more than I do. They’re run by people much smarter than I am, much, much smarter. I’m just grateful they let me along for the ride… If you gave up on Amazon in 2001, you missed the $2 trillion boat.” christian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides retail, advertising, and subscription services, along with devices, media content, and cloud solutions. The company’s platforms serve consumers, businesses, and creators through e-commerce, digital content, and Amazon Web Services. Cramer called the company “arguably the best retailer in the world” during the August 14 episode. He said: “Today, we had a giant run in Amazon, up almost 3%. Why? It’s a follow on move from yesterday’s announcement that the company will be moving to same-day grocery delivery, which the analysts wrote about overnight. Now this is an incredibly disruptive initiative that was basically ignored yesterday. Given that delivery is free with Amazon Prime, it could spell real problems for Instacart, perhaps even DoorDash and Uber. Just as importantly, this announcement changed the narrative about Amazon. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

    "artical_content": "The 10 largest growth-focused U.S. companies now make up 38% of the S&P 500 . Known as the \" Ten Titans ,\" the list includes Nvidia ( NVDA -3.38% ) , Microsoft , Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Broadcom , Tesla , Oracle ( ORCL -5.97% ) , and Netflix ( NFLX -1.87% ) . Oracle, Netflix, and Nvidia have been the best performers of the Titans year to date. Let's determine if these growth stocks have what it takes to continue outperforming next year. Image source: Getty Images. Oracle has innovative ideas, but they come at a price Oracle has been the standout among the Titans. With a year-to-date total return of more than 40%, it vaulted its market cap above $660 billion. ORCL Total Return Level data by YCharts . Oracle was close to dead money in the five years between 2015 and the end of 2019 -- gaining just 17.8% compared to 56.9% for the S&P 500. But since the start of 2020, Oracle is up 345% compared to a 100.6% gain in the S&P 500. A big driver of the outperformance is the build-out and adoption of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Oracle transformed from a database-first company to a fully fledged ecosystem. Not long ago, companies were using Oracle's database software on third-party clouds. Oracle decided to capture that revenue by building out its own cloud services. Oracle Integration Cloud hosts software-as-a-service offerings for financial reporting, automated workflows, human resources operations, marketing, personalization, and more. Oracle also offers artificial intelligence (AI)-powered database services. And OCI has been shown to be much more cost-effective for data-intensive operations than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. It's an especially ideal offering for industries like financial services and healthcare that have complex regulatory frameworks and sensitive information. On its earnings calls, Oracle often discusses how industries are choosing OCI for its security and compliance capabilities. Oracle was already a leader in enterprise software solutions. And now, it is a major player in the cloud business. The main downside of Oracle is that its valuation is expensive, and it is spending extremely aggressively . Oracle is arguably among the higher-risk, higher-potential-reward Titans. If its investments translate to bottom-line earnings growth, it could continue to be one of the best performers in the group. If not, it wouldn't be surprising if the stock underwent a sizable sell-off. Netflix is an entertainment giant that is raking in the cash flow Netflix's outsized returns in recent years are partly due to how beaten down the stock was going into 2023. Netflix fell over 50% in 2022, outpacing the broader sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) that year. At the time, other streaming platforms were gaining traction, and Netflix was still inconsistently profitable. The business model has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. So it's not a transformational story like Oracle. Rather, Netflix has perfected its craft. The biggest change has been its content slate -- what it spends on, how it markets that content (like the global success of \"KPop Demon Hunters ,\") and basically just boosting its overall content success rate. The second major change was cracking down on password sharing. This was a resounding success because a lot of new accounts opened up -- showing that customers were willing to pay for Netflix because they value the service (again, despite a lot of competition). And finally, Netflix's ad-supported tier is driving new signups, which accelerates revenue growth. Netflix is an industry-leading cash cow with high margins. It has become a near-perfect business. The only issue is that the valuation reflects that, as Netflix trades at 52 times trailing 12-month earnings. Netflix could still be a winning long-term stock, but it may need a year or two to grow into its valuation. Therefore, it may not be a standout performer in 2026. Nvidia just delivered another blowout quarter Nvidia reported exceptional second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Aug. 27 despite the company's China business being hindered by export restrictions to China. Even with difficult comps from the second-quarter fiscal 2025, Nvidia grew revenue by 56% and adjusted earnings per share by 54%. Arguably, the most impressive aspect of Nvidia's results is that it continues to sustain ultra-high gross margins over 70%. Nvidia's high margins allow it to convert a substantial amount of sales into profit, which is a testament to its edge over the competition and technological leadership on the global stage. Nvidia gets a lot of attention for its data center business -- and rightfully so, as it made up 88% of revenue in the recent quarter. But it's worth noting that the rest of the business is doing well too. Nvidia's non-data center revenue, which includes gaming and AI PC professional visualization, automotive, and robotics, was collectively $5.49 billion -- up 48% compared to $3.7 billion a year ago. Nvidia is in its third year of what has been an uninterrupted masterclass of exponential growth on a scale unlike any business the world has ever seen. And somehow, the company still has its foot on the gas with no signs of slowing down. Nvidia's outlook for the third-quarter fiscal 2026 calls for $54 billion in revenue even if it ships zero H20 chips to China -- all while maintaining a 73% gross margin. That would mark a 54% increase in revenue and just slightly lower gross margins than third-quarter fiscal 2025 and a near three-fold increase in revenue in just two years. Despite the impeccable results, Nvidia's valuation isn't cheap, as investors are pricing in a sustained breakneck growth rate. But Nvidia just keeps delivering, so its 58.4 price-to-earnings ratio is reasonable. If Nvidia's stock price remained unchanged for a year but the company grew earnings by 50%, the P/E would drop to 38.9. So even now, with the stock on track to crush the S&P 500 for the third consecutive year, Nvidia remains a top AI stock to buy now . I expect Nvidia to continue leading the Ten Titans higher in 2026, especially if trade policy with China eases. However, if for whatever reason there's a slowdown in AI spending from key Nvidia customers, Nvidia could drag down the Ten Titans and the broader market with it.",

    "artical_content": "Big tech companies are set to spend $375 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure this year, according to estimates from analysts at UBS . That number will climb to $500 billion next year. The biggest expense item in building out AI data centers is semiconductors. Nvidia ( NVDA -3.38% ) has been by far the biggest beneficiary of that spend so far. Its GPUs offer best-in-class capabilities for general AI training and inference . Other AI accelerator chipmakers have also seen strong sales growth, including Broadcom ( AVGO -3.70% ) , which makes custom AI chips as well as networking chips, which ensure data moves efficiently from one server to another, keeping downtime to a minimum. Broadcom's stock price has increased more than fivefold since the start of 2023, and the company now sports a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Another year of spectacular growth could easily place it in the $2 trillion club. But another semiconductor stock looks like a more likely candidate to reach that vaunted level, joining Nvidia and the four other members of the club by 2028. Image source: Getty Images. Is Broadcom a $2 trillion company? Broadcom is a massive company with operations spanning hardware and software, but its AI chips business is currently steering the ship. To that end, AI revenue climbed 46% year over year last quarter to reach $4.4 billion. Management expects the current quarter to produce $5.1 billion in AI semiconductor revenue, accelerating growth to roughly 60%. AI-related revenue now accounts for roughly 30% of Broadcom's sales, and that's set to keep climbing over the next few years. Broadcom's acquisition of VMware last year is another growth driver. The software company is now fully integrated into Broadcom's larger operations, and it's seen strong success in upselling customers to the VMware Cloud Foundation, enabling enterprises to run their own private clouds. Over 87% of its customers have transitioned to the new subscription, resulting in double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue . But Broadcom shares are extremely expensive. The stock garners a forward P/E ratio of 45. While its AI chip sales are growing quickly and it's seeing strong margin improvement from VMware, it's important not to lose sight of how broad a company Broadcom is. Despite the stellar growth in those two businesses, the company is still only growing its top line at about 20% year over year. Investors should expect only incremental margin improvements going forward as it scales the AI accelerator business. That means the business is set up for strong earnings growth, but not enough to justify its 45 times earnings multiple. Another semiconductor stock trades at a much more reasonable multiple, and is growing just as fast. The semiconductor giant poised to join the $2 trillion club by 2028 Both Broadcom and Nvidia rely on another company to ensure they can create the most advanced semiconductors in the world for AI training and inference. That company is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM -3.05% ) , which actually prints and packages both companies' designs. Almost every company designing leading-edge chips relies on TSMC for its technological capabilities. As a result, its market share of semiconductor manufacturing has climbed to more than two-thirds. TSMC benefits from a virtuous cycle, ensuring it maintains and grows its massive market share. Its technology lead helps it win big contracts from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. That gives it the capital to invest in expanding capacity and research and development for its next-generation process. As a result, it maintains its technology lead while offering enough capacity to meet the growing demand for manufacturing. TSMC's leading-edge process node, dubbed N2, will reportedly charge a 66% premium per silicon wafer over the previous generation (N3). That's a much bigger step-up in price than it's historically managed, but the demand for the process is strong as companies are willing to spend whatever it takes to access the next bump in power and energy efficiency. While TSMC typically experiences a significant drop off in gross margin as it ramps up a new expensive node with lower initial yields, its current pricing should help it maintain its margins for years to come as it eventually transitions to an even more advanced process next year. Management expects AI-related revenue to average mid-40% growth per year from 2024 through 2029. While AI chips are still a relatively small part of TSMC's business, that should produce overall revenue growth of about 20% for the business. Its ability to maintain a strong gross margin as it ramps up the next two manufacturing processes should allow it to produce operating earnings growth exceeding that 20% mark. TSMC's stock trades at a much more reasonable earnings multiple of 24 times expectations. Considering the business could generate earnings growth in the low 20% range, that's a great price for the stock. If it can maintain that earnings multiple through 2028 while growing earnings at about 20% per year, the stock will be worth well over $2 trillion at that point.",

In the most recent quarter, well-known billionaire investors bought Amazon ( AMZN -1.16% ) , Restaurant Brands International ( QSR 0.44% ) , and Whirlpool ( WHR -0.44% ) . Let's see what might make these good picks for investors now. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Amazon: AI and more It's easy to see why billionaires have been piling into Amazon. The e-commerce giant has developed a formidable artificial intelligence (AI) business as part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division , and it looks like that's a massive opportunity. Even though it's the second-largest company in the world by sales, Amazon is still reporting double-digit growth, which is extremely impressive. Sales increased 13% over last year in the second quarter, with a strong showing from AWS at almost 18%. E-commerce was stronger than expected as customers rushed to buy certain items that are likely to increase in price due to tariffs , and sales were up 11% over last year. Advertising revenue accelerated to 23% and was the fastest-growing segment. Amazon is also highly profitable. Operating income rose from $14.7 billion last year to $19.2 billion this year in the quarter, coming in way ahead of the high end of management's guidance. What makes the Amazon position even more compelling today is its price. Amazon has historically traded at a premium valuation, and it's been looking cheap. At the current price, it trades at a P/E ratio of 34, less than half of its five-year average of 76. Billionaire Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital bought 5,823,316 shares of Amazon stock worth $1.2 billion in the second quarter, and many of your favorite billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett, own it too. It may take some time for Amazon stock to get back to its market-beating performance, but these billionaires see an incredible opportunity here. With its reliable growth and continued potential, Amazon is a nearly universal stock that fits most portfolios. 2. Restaurant Brands: Resilient model and high dividend Restaurant Brands International owns four fast-food chains: Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeye's, and Firehouse Subs. Burger King is its largest brand, with 19,700 stores globally, and all of its brands together have more than 32,000 stores. All of its restaurants are franchises , which is an excellent model for generating cash. Since the company itself doesn't build stores or buy food, it just sells franchises, it has low capital expenditures and just collects franchise fees. Value investors love these kinds of companies. Since its companies make fast food, they've been doing well in the pressured environment. On a consolidated basis, total restaurant sales increased 5.3% year over year in the second quarter, and revenue was up 16% year over year. Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Management bought 751,100 shares of Restaurant Brands stock worth almost $41 million in the second quarter. Bill Ackman also owns it, having taken a position in the precursor to the current iteration of the company in 2012.It's his fund's third-largest position, at 11%. Restaurant Brands is a value stock , and investors buy it because they believe it's undervalued relative to its potential. It also pays a piping-hot dividend yielding 3.8%, which makes it very attractive for passive income investors. If you're in the value camp or looking for a solid dividend stock, Restaurant Brands International could fit the bill. 3. Whirlpool: Made in the U.S.A. Whirlpool is a U.S. manufacturer of home appliances under brand names like its own Whirlpool brand as well as Maytag and KitchenAid. Its products are highly sensitive to the housing market, and it's been struggling with the housing pressure brought on by high interest rates. However, things might be turning around. In fact, speaking of stocks that billionaires are buying, several well-known billionaire investors have been scooping up home builder stocks, and Whirlpool is in similar circumstances. Not only will it benefit from a resurgence in home buying and the new appliances that typically accompany that, it also has a $2 billion builders business. It also has an edge over foreign competitors as higher tariffs take effect. Whirlpool is actually experiencing some near-term headwinds because of tariffs as the competition front-loads its products in the U.S. to evade coming tariffs, but it's well-positioned to reap the benefits down the line. Shares of Whirlpool are a bargain today, trading at a forward 1-year P/E ratio of 11, and billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa bought 266,092 shares of Whirlpool stock in the second quarter worth $27 million. However, potential investors should understand the risk with Whirlpool. It may take time for its tariff benefit to kick in, and in the meantime, it's cutting its dividend in half to conserve cash.",

    "artical_content": "Buying and holding shares of the best businesses in the world is the easiest way to build wealth over the long term. Some of the largest, most profitable companies in the world also just happen to be in a prime position to benefit from global adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) , which is expected to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to PwC. Investors wondering where to place their bets only have to look at the latest round of quarterly disclosures from the wealthiest investors. Billionaire fund managers are required to report their holdings on Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Here are two dominant tech companies that prominent billionaires were buying in the second quarter. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Microsoft Stanley Druckenmiller bought a new position in Microsoft ( MSFT -0.65% ) for his Duquesne Family Office in the second quarter. Druckenmiller has led a successful career, previously managing billions in assets for clients before closing his hedge fund in 2010. Other billionaire fund managers, such as Daniel Loeb of Third Point and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global, were also adding to their firms' stakes in the stock last quarter. There's a lot to like about Microsoft. It has a long history of generating steady growth in revenue and profits. Over the past year, it generated $102 billion in net profit on $282 billion in revenue. While there's talk on Wall Street of a potential AI bubble, Microsoft continues to report strong financial results and point to opportunities that bolster the investment case. The reason to like Microsoft right now is that it is seeing strong demand for its Azure cloud service for enterprise. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 39% year over year in the June-ending quarter. This is higher than the previous quarter's 33% growth. \"We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses, given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog,\" CFO Amy Hood said during the earnings call. What this means is that investors are likely still underestimating the demand for AI cloud infrastructure. AI is completely transforming how businesses operate, and we can see this in Microsoft's growing investment in data centers and technology. Its capital expenditures have more than doubled over the past two years to $64 billion, and Hood's statement suggests these investments will keep growing. Importantly, Microsoft's strong cloud growth shows that it is competing effectively with Amazon ( AMZN -1.16% ) , which has led the cloud market for many years. It's also competing against Alphabet 's Google Cloud, which has made great strides over the past year with Gemini -- one of the best AI models out there. The dilemma for investors buying Microsoft stock is its valuation. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 is nearly three times Microsoft's expected earnings growth of 12% over the long term. A good rule of thumb is to look for growth stocks trading at a PEG ratio closer to 1. But Druckenmiller may see Wall Street's consensus earnings estimate as too conservative, as it reported a 24% year-over-year increase in earnings last quarter, and management's commentary still points to a lot more growth ahead. Image source: Getty Images. 2. Amazon Druckenmiller sold out of Amazon in favor of Microsoft last quarter, which may reflect his belief that Azure's momentum puts it in a superior position in AI. But other billionaires see upside for the e-commerce and cloud leader. Pershing Square's Bill Ackman bought over 5.8 million shares of Amazon stock in Q2, a large stake worth nearly $1.3 billion at quarter's end. Ackman has a record of delivering market-beating returns for his investors. Over the last 22 years, Pershing Square grew an original investment by a 27-fold, compared to a 9-fold gain if clients had invested in the S&P 500 . Ackman prefers to concentrate his portfolio in a handful of carefully selected investment opportunities, usually no more than a dozen holdings. This means only his highest-conviction ideas make it into the portfolio. This investment by Ackman comes as Amazon saw a notable acceleration in growth for its e-commerce business in the second quarter. Its total sales grew 12% year over year on a constant-currency basis, driven by a 10% increase in the online store. This is the first quarter of double-digit growth for the online store since Q3 2022. Moreover, management continues to focus on improving cost efficiency in processing and shipping orders to customers. Amazon has seen its operating profit increase by a whopping 471% since 2022 to $77 billion over the last year. The only negative for Amazon is that its cloud business ( Amazon Web Services ) is growing at about half the rate of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. There could be several reasons why businesses are opting for a competitor over Amazon in the cloud market, but investors shouldn't overlook the value AWS brings to Amazon's business. Amazon has gained valuable AI capabilities that power product recommendations, optimize delivery routes, and improve product experiences with the Alexa voice assistant. Amazon Web Services (AWS) could slip to the No. 2 spot in the cloud market, but that doesn't mean AWS is a lost cause. AWS's generative AI business is experiencing triple-digit growth, while 85% of information technology spending is still going to on-premises servers. With the size of that opportunity, AWS should keep growing for many years. Its revenue grew 17% year over year in Q2, after signing new agreements with PepsiCo , Airbnb , and Peloton Interactive . Ackman may see more room for management to improve margins in the online retail business, in addition to a lot of opportunity for double-digit growth in cloud computing. The stock's forward P/E of 34 reflects high investor expectations for growth, as the consensus analyst estimate calls for Amazon's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 18% in the coming years, which is higher than estimates for Microsoft.",

    "artical_content": "Lots of ink has already been spilled about Warren Buffett 's recent market activity. What's significant is the tremendous cash position and 11 quarters of net selling. However, he and his team have found what to buy these days as well. There's a clear pattern in what interests Buffett today, and based on his buying activity, I think Walmart ( WMT 0.88% ) would fit right in. Not Walmart's first rodeo Buffett actually did own Walmart for stock for about 13 years, from 2005 through 2018. It was one of Berkshire Hathaway 's largest holdings at first, but he began selling it off in 2015, and he exited the position in 2018. Image source: Walmart. At the time, he praised Walmart, calling it \"a fabulous company,\" but he seemed to be worried about retail in light of Amazon's success with e-commerce. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway bought Amazon stock right after that, in 2019. He wasn't wrong. Walmart was late to the e-commerce party, and it took time for the retail giant to really get into it. However, it's getting stronger and stronger, and e-commerce sales growth accelerated to 25% year over year in the 2025 fiscal second quarter (ended Aug. 1). However, since January 2019, somewhere in the middle of the Walmart stock sale and Amazon stock purchase, Walmart has outperformed Amazon. WMT Total Return Level data by YCharts Cutting the flowers Did Buffett make a mistake? He noted several years ago, \"Just as Walmart was once totally underestimated by the seers of its time, the idea some guy in Bentonville, Arkansas, would take them to the cleaners, that was the situation at first with traditional retailers, and Amazon. You want to be underestimated at first.\" It seems like Buffett underestimated Walmart himself when he sold out of it. He has made the mistake that many investors say is their biggest: selling winners too soon. When he made his famous quote about his favorite holding time being \"forever,\" he referenced Peter Lynch as likening \"such behavior\" to holding on to losers in the hopes of a turnaround while selling winners \"to cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.\" But there's a way back. Fitting the Buffett model There are specific criteria Buffett always talks about in a great stock: excellent management, an important role in the economy, commitment to shareholder value, and not needing to spend a lot of money to make a lot of money. Investors often think of him as a value investor, but his focus is more on the underlying business than getting a bargain. He says he looks for \"a sensible price tag.\" These days, there are some themes in the companies his team is choosing to invest in. One obvious feature is that they are predominantly, or even entirely, leaders in their fields. Consider Pool Corp , Domino's Pizza , and UnitedHealth Group . These are literally the largest companies in their respective industries. And while UnitedHealth looks like the kind of rare bargain opportunity Buffett pounces on, the others weren't necessarily so cheap when Buffett bought them. Consider their forward, one-year P/E ratios and price-to-sales ratios . WMT PS Ratio data by YCharts Why Walmart today? Here's how Walmart fits in today. It's the largest retailer in the world, and despite slowing growth and the threat of Amazon, it has retained its status. Not only that, but it has the advantage of 4,600 domestic stores to use as distribution hubs, something Amazon can't match. Store deliveries increased 50% over last year in the second quarter, and they were fast -- a third were delivered in under three hours. Walmart is flexing its retail muscle, and it's absorbing some of the impact of tariffs so that it can still offer great value to its customers. Smaller outfits can't do that, at least to the extent Walmart can. Walmart is also a Dividend King , and it has raised its dividend for the past 52 years. That's commitment to creating shareholder value. Finally, if Buffett is beefing up positions in industry leaders while saving money for opportunities at a later point, it seems like he expects these stalwarts to manage through the dips and corrections that make those opportunities possible, anchoring the portfolio and minimizing potential losses. With its essential products and discount prices, Walmart can gain market share in challenging times, and it shouldn't be underestimated again.",

    "artical_content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" have been the driving force behind the current bull market. The seven companies currently make up over one-third of the total market cap of the S&P 500 , wielding a huge amount of influence over the benchmark index. This year's results have been mixed for the \"Magnificent Seven.\" While Nvidia and Meta Platforms ( META -1.69% ) are posting another year of market-beating returns, others like Apple ( AAPL -0.19% ) and Amazon have failed to keep up with the rest of the market. But recent moves from Meta and Apple could help another member's stock price soar well above the market averages once again in 2025 and beyond. Image source: Getty Images. A new big customer for this AI giant Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are in competition with one another, often in multiple areas. But that won't stop any of them from forming partnerships that make sense for both businesses. Such is the case with a recent deal Meta signed with Alphabet ( GOOG 0.56% ) ( GOOGL 0.60% ) . While the two compete for digital advertising dollars, Meta needs something Alphabet has: Compute. Meta's building out new data centers as fast as it can, but its AI developments need more compute now. That's why it struck a deal with Alphabet's Google Cloud, committing to $10 billion in spend over the next six years. After a massive hiring spree this summer, Meta needs to ensure that its highly compensated AI teams have enough compute power to develop all the projects it's working on. That ranges from relatively simple machine learning models powering its recommendation engine to its new AI superintelligence team . Meanwhile, Alphabet's spending heavily to meet customer demand. Management recently updated its 2025 capital expenditures outlook from $75 billion to $85 billion. That said, management said during its second-quarter earnings call that it remains in a \"tight demand-supply environment.\" Its backlog climbed to $106 billion as of the end of the quarter. Another $10 billion on top of that from Meta represents nearly a 10% boost. Alphabet is rapidly growing its cloud computing segment, and Meta's new spend is helping. While it's still scaling, Google Cloud sports an operating margin of just 21%. That's well below Amazon Web Services, which is roughly twice its size and held an operating margin of 37% over the last 12 months. But Alphabet has seen its operating margin expand considerably over the last two years as it scales, so it could quickly approach AWS levels of profitability. Meta's business is a big win for Alphabet, as it helps it catch up with larger rivals like AWS. Apple could deepen its relationship Apple and Alphabet have a long-standing relationship, which has made the Google search engine the default in the Safari web browser for years. Alphabet reportedly pays $20 billion for that privilege, so it's a good bet that it's getting even more out of it from ad revenue. The company's traffic acquisition costs last quarter totaled $14.7 billion, versus $54.2 billion in Google Search revenue. Now, Apple is reportedly considering using a third-party large language model for the long-awaited AI-powered Siri assistant. Apple has struggled to incorporate AI into Siri and deliver other promised iPhone features that rely on generative AI. Instead of using its own Apple Intelligence LLM, it could use Google's Gemini. Such a deal would not only bring in additional revenue for Alphabet from a massive customer, it could cement its position as the default search engine for Safari for years to come. That said, Alphabet's awaiting a ruling from a federal judge detailing remedies for its monopolistic powers. That might include a ban on deals like it's made with Apple , making it the default search engine. However, a Gemini-powered Siri may provide another way to drive traffic to its properties. Alphabet's rack rate pricing for Gemini isn't cheap. With over 2 billion active devices, Apple will likely pay billions of dollars per year to Alphabet to use its LLM in Siri. That can provide a meaningful bump to Alphabet's top line, even as it approaches $400 billion in annual revenue. Alphabet's ability to win valuable contracts from Meta and Apple should encourage investors going forward. The two tech companies are poised to remain two of the biggest AI spenders in the world, and Alphabet's positioned itself to take a significant share of that spending. With its shares trading for just 21 times forward earnings , the stock looks like a bargain. While it's weighed down by regulatory uncertainty, it's showing promising results across its business.",
