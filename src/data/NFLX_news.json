    "artical_content": "The 10 largest growth-focused U.S. companies now make up 38% of the S&P 500 . Known as the \" Ten Titans ,\" the list includes Nvidia ( NVDA -3.38% ) , Microsoft , Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Broadcom , Tesla , Oracle ( ORCL -5.97% ) , and Netflix ( NFLX -1.87% ) . Oracle, Netflix, and Nvidia have been the best performers of the Titans year to date. Let's determine if these growth stocks have what it takes to continue outperforming next year. Image source: Getty Images. Oracle has innovative ideas, but they come at a price Oracle has been the standout among the Titans. With a year-to-date total return of more than 40%, it vaulted its market cap above $660 billion. ORCL Total Return Level data by YCharts . Oracle was close to dead money in the five years between 2015 and the end of 2019 -- gaining just 17.8% compared to 56.9% for the S&P 500. But since the start of 2020, Oracle is up 345% compared to a 100.6% gain in the S&P 500. A big driver of the outperformance is the build-out and adoption of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Oracle transformed from a database-first company to a fully fledged ecosystem. Not long ago, companies were using Oracle's database software on third-party clouds. Oracle decided to capture that revenue by building out its own cloud services. Oracle Integration Cloud hosts software-as-a-service offerings for financial reporting, automated workflows, human resources operations, marketing, personalization, and more. Oracle also offers artificial intelligence (AI)-powered database services. And OCI has been shown to be much more cost-effective for data-intensive operations than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. It's an especially ideal offering for industries like financial services and healthcare that have complex regulatory frameworks and sensitive information. On its earnings calls, Oracle often discusses how industries are choosing OCI for its security and compliance capabilities. Oracle was already a leader in enterprise software solutions. And now, it is a major player in the cloud business. The main downside of Oracle is that its valuation is expensive, and it is spending extremely aggressively . Oracle is arguably among the higher-risk, higher-potential-reward Titans. If its investments translate to bottom-line earnings growth, it could continue to be one of the best performers in the group. If not, it wouldn't be surprising if the stock underwent a sizable sell-off. Netflix is an entertainment giant that is raking in the cash flow Netflix's outsized returns in recent years are partly due to how beaten down the stock was going into 2023. Netflix fell over 50% in 2022, outpacing the broader sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) that year. At the time, other streaming platforms were gaining traction, and Netflix was still inconsistently profitable. The business model has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. So it's not a transformational story like Oracle. Rather, Netflix has perfected its craft. The biggest change has been its content slate -- what it spends on, how it markets that content (like the global success of \"KPop Demon Hunters ,\") and basically just boosting its overall content success rate. The second major change was cracking down on password sharing. This was a resounding success because a lot of new accounts opened up -- showing that customers were willing to pay for Netflix because they value the service (again, despite a lot of competition). And finally, Netflix's ad-supported tier is driving new signups, which accelerates revenue growth. Netflix is an industry-leading cash cow with high margins. It has become a near-perfect business. The only issue is that the valuation reflects that, as Netflix trades at 52 times trailing 12-month earnings. Netflix could still be a winning long-term stock, but it may need a year or two to grow into its valuation. Therefore, it may not be a standout performer in 2026. Nvidia just delivered another blowout quarter Nvidia reported exceptional second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Aug. 27 despite the company's China business being hindered by export restrictions to China. Even with difficult comps from the second-quarter fiscal 2025, Nvidia grew revenue by 56% and adjusted earnings per share by 54%. Arguably, the most impressive aspect of Nvidia's results is that it continues to sustain ultra-high gross margins over 70%. Nvidia's high margins allow it to convert a substantial amount of sales into profit, which is a testament to its edge over the competition and technological leadership on the global stage. Nvidia gets a lot of attention for its data center business -- and rightfully so, as it made up 88% of revenue in the recent quarter. But it's worth noting that the rest of the business is doing well too. Nvidia's non-data center revenue, which includes gaming and AI PC professional visualization, automotive, and robotics, was collectively $5.49 billion -- up 48% compared to $3.7 billion a year ago. Nvidia is in its third year of what has been an uninterrupted masterclass of exponential growth on a scale unlike any business the world has ever seen. And somehow, the company still has its foot on the gas with no signs of slowing down. Nvidia's outlook for the third-quarter fiscal 2026 calls for $54 billion in revenue even if it ships zero H20 chips to China -- all while maintaining a 73% gross margin. That would mark a 54% increase in revenue and just slightly lower gross margins than third-quarter fiscal 2025 and a near three-fold increase in revenue in just two years. Despite the impeccable results, Nvidia's valuation isn't cheap, as investors are pricing in a sustained breakneck growth rate. But Nvidia just keeps delivering, so its 58.4 price-to-earnings ratio is reasonable. If Nvidia's stock price remained unchanged for a year but the company grew earnings by 50%, the P/E would drop to 38.9. So even now, with the stock on track to crush the S&P 500 for the third consecutive year, Nvidia remains a top AI stock to buy now . I expect Nvidia to continue leading the Ten Titans higher in 2026, especially if trade policy with China eases. However, if for whatever reason there's a slowdown in AI spending from key Nvidia customers, Nvidia could drag down the Ten Titans and the broader market with it.",

    "artical_content": "Once upon a time, not too long ago, Netflix ( NFLX -1.87% ) was a driving force on the stock market. As a member of the exclusive four-member FANG group, and the FAANG successor , Netflix wrote headlines every time it coughed. It wasn't a huge entertainment empire at the time, but many investors could see that kind of future for Netflix in 2013 or 2017. Things have changed in recent years. Netflix has gone through some hard times, appointed a pair of co-CEOs, changed how it manages and reports the media-streaming business, and more. Around the company, a new industry of streaming platforms with exclusive content has evolved. And after several deep stock dips and recoveries, Netflix now sports a market cap of more than $500 billion. Will Netflix ever join the trillion-dollar club of current stock market titans, or is that an impossible fairy tale? Let's find out. Netflix's place among tech titans The more things change, the more familiar they become. The modern version of FANG or FAANG is the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of enormous tech stocks. Netflix is the only FAANG stock that doesn't appear on the Magnificent Seven list today. It's not too far away, though. There are only 10 companies with trillion-dollar market caps, and Netflix is among the 20 largest caps today. From this purely numerical perspective (set theory in action!), Netflix has a better chance than most to join the trillion-dollar club someday. Market cap roller coaster Netflix's lofty perch on a $519 billion market cap seemed quite improbable just a couple of years ago. The inflation panic of 2022 overlapped with a maturing media-streaming sector, and Netflix adapted to the changes in some uncomfortable ways. Many investors disliked how the company cracked down on account-sharing members at first, and the new subscription plans with built-in advertising but lower monthly fees also rubbed Netflix watchers against the grain. Netflix's soaring stock chart went off the rails at that point. The market cap plunged from $306 billion to $74 billion in just a few months. But I bought more Netflix stock in that dip, much like I did when the Qwikster debacle undermined Netflix's stock in 2011. That particular tranche of my multi-part Netflix position has now gained a market-beating 215% since March 2022. You'd be even better off if you picked up Netflix shares at the deeper discounts in the weeks and months that followed -- but I'm not complaining. Time in the market almost always beats market timing , after all. Netflix isn't cheap, but that's OK So Netflix has proven that it can post strong shareholder returns in a hurry -- at least when starting from a temporary bargain-bin discount. That's not the situation today, of course. Netflix shares are trading at the generous valuation of 52 times earnings or 61 times free cash flows. It's pricey even if you include the company's high-octane growth in the equation; I can't call a price-to-sales ratio of 12.5 or PEG ratio of 2.0 \"cheap\" with a straight face. The stock may be due for a price correction someday. But I'm not cashing in my Netflix gains with a stock sale, anyway. Remember what I said about time in the market -- I have no idea where Netflix's stock will go next week or next year, but I'm certain that its growth story will add more chapters in the long run. These data points matter and here are the ones you can skip. Image source: Getty Images. Why I'm holding my Netflix stock for the long haul That's why I'll sit through the price dips and periods of uncertainty, looking forward to robust stock returns over several years. Nothing is ever a sure thing, especially in the capricious stock market, and Netflix's future prosperity is no exception. At the same time, this company has proven its mettle so many times, it's getting hard to keep score. The constant pursuit of big hits continues. Netflix is trying new ideas like video games, real-world entertainment destinations, and screening its biggest hits on the silver screen now. Some of these bets will pay off and others won't. Overall, Netflix is earning its place in the next edition of FAANG or Magnificent Seven stocks. I don't know when Netflix's market cap will cross that nice-sounding yet immaterial trillion-dollar goal line, but it probably will get there eventually. And I expect Netflix's long-term gains to continue from there.",

    "artical_content": "In 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization. Several more have joined that club since, but it remains highly exclusive, with fewer than 10 members among the thousands of stocks trading on equity markets. The good news for investors is that more companies will also reach this milestone eventually, producing excellent returns along the way. Let's discuss two stocks that could get there within five years: Eli Lilly ( LLY 0.07% ) and Netflix ( NFLX -1.87% ) . Redefining the meaning of a blockbuster Eli Lilly could become the leading pharmaceutical company in terms of sales by 2030, a feat it is well-positioned to achieve thanks to its GLP-1 lineup. The company's tirzepatide, marketed under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound for diabetes and weight management, respectively, is breaking records. First approved in 2022, tirzepatide is on track to generate well over $20 billion in sales this year. Image source: Getty Images. Most medicines in the industry never become blockbusters . Most that do have to wait years after their launch before that milestone. Tirzepatide is a different animal altogether, and according to some projections, it is on track to generate $62 billion in sales by 2030, annual sales never before seen in the industry for a single compound. Not even Comirnaty, a vaccine that helped curb a global pandemic, hit that number at its peak. This means that the pace at which Eli Lilly has been growing its top line lately should be the norm for the company over the next five years. In the second quarter, the drugmaker's revenue increased by 38% year over year (an exceptional number for a pharmaceutical giant) to $15.6 billion. Then there's the rest of Eli Lilly's lineup and the many pipeline candidates across diabetes, obesity, oncology, pain, and other areas that the company boasts. Add to all that Eli Lilly's solid dividend program with rapidly growing payouts -- they have more than doubled over the past five years -- and you've got an excellent stock to hold for the next half a decade and beyond. Eli Lilly's market cap is currently $660 billion. It needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.67% to hit a $1 trillion valuation by 2030. The company's revenue and earnings should grow much faster than that through the end of the decade and allow it to join this highly exclusive club. Changing the way we watch TV The cord-cutting trend is in full swing, largely thanks to Netflix's efforts. Cable is slowly being phased out, but it's not time to say its eulogy yet. Older generations who grew up with cable are keeping it alive, meaning there is still massive whitespace for Netflix to bring viewing hours into its ecosystem. The company estimated a revenue opportunity of more than $650 billion, which dwarfs its trailing 12-month sales of $41.5 billion. True, the streaming landscape has evolved, with significantly more competition now. Some thought Netflix wouldn't survive the shift. But since 2019, when major corporations, including Apple and Walt Disney , launched competing platforms, Netflix has performed extremely well. We can credit Netflix's management for adapting to the new landscape. It launched a low-price ad-supported tier and cracked down on password sharing. The company also continues to increase prices without losing a significant market share, a testament to its incredible brand loyalty . Furthermore, Netflix's extensive ecosystem enables it to create new, original, high-quality content tailored to the preferences of its viewers. In my view, the next five years could resemble the past for Netflix. Though revenue isn't growing as fast as it was, earnings and free cash flow have soared. NFLX Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Expect that trend to continue through the end of the decade as the streaming giant makes more headway into its large untapped market. Netflix's current market cap of $520 billion means it needs a CAGR of about 14% in the next five years to become a trillion-dollar stock. That's a difficult thing to achieve, but Netflix could pull it off. Even if it doesn't quite get there, Netflix is a terrific stock to own well beyond the next five years.",

We’ll explore how Netflix’s move into live sports streaming in Japan could reshape its investment case and global growth outlook. Outshine the giants: these 20 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement. Netflix Investment Narrative Recap To own Netflix shares, I believe in the company’s ability to continually drive global subscriber growth through diversified content and new monetization streams. With “KPop Demon Hunters” leading the box office and the landmark deal to stream the 2026 World Baseball Classic in Japan, Netflix is emphasizing event-driven engagement to supplement its traditional streaming model. However, these moves do not materially disrupt the short-term focus on international expansion and cost efficiency, nor do they alleviate the persistent risk of escalating content expenses outpacing revenue growth. Of Netflix’s recent updates, the exclusive TF1 partnership in France stands out as especially relevant, highlighting an ongoing commitment to partnerships with local media leaders. Enhanced local offerings remain a crucial catalyst for deepening penetration and unlocking higher engagement in major international markets where incremental subscribers and ad revenue are increasingly critical to the story. But with this progress, it’s also worth remembering that rising content costs continue to present a real challenge for Netflix when... Read the full narrative on Netflix (it's free!)

    "artical_content": "Media-streaming veteran Netflix ( NFLX -1.87% ) is trying a bunch of new things. The king of digital entertainment is adopting a bunch of old-school ideas right now. Some of these moves are already turning heads, but is this a unique moment in time or a fresh long-term strategy for Netflix? From Netflix views to Billboard hits I'm sure you've seen a few of the headlines already. KPop Demon Hunters , an animated musical movie produced by Sony Pictures ( SONY -1.73% ) with exclusive distribution right for Netflix, is setting records. Two months after the June 20 release, it's Netflix's second most-watched movie of all time (behind Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson starrer Red Notice ). It will probably take the top spot in the next weekly official report, due on Wednesday. Inspired by the massive viewership, Netflix sent the film out to theaters, too. Earning $18 million on a fairly slow August weekend, it became the company's first movie to hit #1 on the weekly box office report. At the same time, the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack landed four songs on the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 list. That includes a second top-spot showing for the lead hit Golden . It's been decades since a soundtrack came close to this dominant showing. Naturally, Golden also leads this week's Spotify ( SPOT -0.70% ) play chart. On Alphabet 's ( GOOG 0.56% ) ( GOOGL 0.63% ) YouTube Music service, the KPop Demon Hunters owns the top 7 spots right now. Netflix has a unique power to steer the cultural zeitgeist like this. The KPop charting success reminds me of Stranger Things giving Kate Bush and Metallica best-selling hits some 35 years after the original releases, or Squid Game sweeping the globe with Korean-language drama. But that's not all. Netflix is opening real-world entertainment centers themed around its hit shows. The first two Netflix House locations will open in November (Philadelphia) and December (Dallas), followed by Las Vegas in 2027. If the ticket sales and related merchandise offerings come in strong, I would expect Netflix to expand this concept to other cities. Netflix visits the real world That's a lot of real-world action from a purely digital entertainment specialist. Before this plethora of physical reality content, Netflix fans had to soothe their Netflix swag cravings with a handful of licensed T-shirts from Target ( TGT -0.85% ) and Funko Pop figures. I mean, the Netflix.shop e-commerce store has been around since 2021, but when's the last time you visited that store? And that's still an online experience, even if it puts some physical items in your mailbox. That's not the same thing as exploring a favorite brand , band, studio, or show with hands-on access to stuff in a local store. Only time will tell whether Netflix leans any further into the physical entertainment angle. For all the endorphin-pushing pleasure of playing Bridgerton mini golf or entering the Squid Game world in virtual reality, brand-centric exploration centers can grow stale over time. And it takes a special kind of creative genius to dominate the pop charts like KPop Demon Hunters is doing right now. You can't count on hitting that high note on a regular basis. Image source: Getty Images. Could Netflix become the next Disney (or Universal)? So I do expect Netflix to try a few more real-world ideas, perhaps ending in full-fledged theme parks someday. Every step along that path moves Netflix just a little bit closer to the old-school entertainment empires of Comcast 's ( CMCSA 1.21% ) Universal Studios or Walt Disney ( DIS 0.64% ) . I don't know whether that's good or bad for Netflix, its customers, or its investors in the long run. Done right, turning back the clock to the golden age of theme parks, radio play, and movie theaters might be refreshing -- but how long will it last, and what comes next? But those are extremely long-term issues that may not affect the increasingly digital entertainment industry in this decade or the next. For now, I appreciate Netflix's openness to alternative business tactics. That's how the company killed Blockbuster, shut down the resulting DVD-mailing winner, and built today's streaming business on those ashes.",

SHAREFacebookLinkedInBlueskyXLink[Photo: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix] BY Chris Stokel-WalkerListen to this ArticleMore info0:00 / 0:00Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’ latest season of her reality show, With Love, Meghan, drops today on Netflix. In line with the streamer’s strategy for its flagship programs, all eight episodes are available to binge immediately.It’s a strategy that serves journalists well, offering plenty of controversial moments to highlight from a celebrity whose ties to the U.K. royal family continue to generate headlines. But it also underscores how approaches to consuming content have changed.Historically, TV shows aired new episodes week after week, creating appointment viewing. With the streaming era, that model shifted—though Netflix remains unique in its commitment to releasing entire seasons at once, according to recent analysis by Ampere Analysis, a research company.Some 84% of Netflix’s original TV releases are full-season drops, compared with 60% on Disney+, 57% on Peacock, and only 34% on Apple TV+. HBO Max is the least likely to release entire seasons, with just 28% of its programming arriving all at once.“Netflix rose to prominence with this facilitating binge viewing model, and it’s what a lot of Netflix audience has come to expect with their new favorite shows coming out,” says Rahul Patel, principal analyst at Ampere Analysis.Beyond audience expectations, practical considerations also drive the approach. “Netflix has always done the binge strategy,” says Kasey Moore, founder of What’s on Netflix, which tracks the platform’s new releases. That’s largely due to the sheer volume of its output. “It’s because the amount of shows and movies that they’re putting out,” he says.The scale of Netflix’s operations prevents it from devoting marketing efforts to weekly episode drops. Instead, releasing entire seasons at once allows for large-scale promotion of specific titles. “Apple TV+ is a really good example where they just don’t have that volume of output,” Moore adds. He once tried to map out in a spreadsheet how Netflix could release everything weekly but found “dozens and dozens of shows” overlapping, making it impractical. Only 2% of Netflix programming is released weekly, compared with 33% on HBO Max, according to Ampere Analysis.Scale, Patel agrees, is central to Netflix’s strategy. “Netflix is releasing content at such a high frequency that when it comes to considering churn mitigation, it’s essentially the subsequent big release that’s coming out in two, three, or four weeks’ time that’s keeping subscribers engaged with the service,” he says. Expecting viewers to wait six to eight weeks for a full season is unrealistic for Netflix. By contrast, Disney+, with far fewer releases, experiments with alternative models. Roughly one in four of its shows drop multiple episodes per week, though not full seasons. Amazon’s Prime Video employs a similar approach, balancing stacked premieres with weekly episodes.According to Patel, Netflix’s incumbency enables its all-at-once model in a way rivals cannot match. Subscribers often factor a Netflix subscription into their monthly expenses, while newer streamers must actively keep users engaged across billing cycles. “If a subscriber is joining for a particular show, they might need to stay subscribed for the following nine weeks, for the rest of the run,” Patel explains. “In an alternative world, if that show was released all in one go, that’s an instance where they could binge watch across a weekend or a couple of weeks, and then perhaps churn from the service.”Whether Netflix’s “big drop” approach actually works remains debated. “It depends who you’re looking at,” says Moore. “Netflix is always Netflix first, rather than basing itself on any individual show, but I’m not sure you could say that about some of its rivals anymore.” For competitors, the brand image is more closely tied to individual programs.“With a lot of these services, the brand image is obviously very important, and a lot of that does come from the content and the type of content they have,” Patel says.The early-rate deadline for Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies Awards is Friday, September 5, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
