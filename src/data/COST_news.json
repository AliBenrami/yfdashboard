    "artical_content": "Over the past five years, Costco 's ( COST -0.23% ) stock rallied 174% as the S&P 500 rose 86%. The warehouse retailer crushed the market even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds rattled the global economy. That was a great run, but can Costco keep outperforming the market over the next five years? Let's review its business model, growth rates, and valuations to decide. Image source: Getty Images. Why is Costco's business model so resilient? Costco's members pay annual fees to shop at its warehouses, and those high-margin fees allow it to sell its products at nearly break-even margins. To keep its prices low, it leverages its scale to negotiate bulk rates with its suppliers. It also limits its markups while promoting its own private label, Kirkland, as a cheaper alternative to name brands. Costco carries a narrower selection of products than traditional big box retailers, but it frequently rotates its products with a \"treasure hunt\" strategy to draw shoppers back to its stores. Its food court, gas stations, vision center, hearing center, and other ancillary services make its memberships even stickier. How fast is Costco growing? Costco's business will stay healthy as long as its comparable sales rise, it opens more warehouses, it gains more cardholders, and it locks them in with high renewal rates. All four of those metrics increased at a healthy clip from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2024 (which ended last September). Metric FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Adjusted* Comps Growth 9.2% 13.4% 10.6% 5.2% 5.9% Total Warehouses 795 815 838 861 890 Total Cardholders 105.5M 116.1M 118.9M 127.9M 136.8M Global Renewal Rate 88% 89% 90% 90.4% 90.5% Data source: Costco. *Excludes fuel sales and foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of fiscal 2025, Costco's adjusted comps rose 8.1% year over year. It ended the third quarter with 905 warehouses, 142.8 million cardholders, and a global renewal rate of 90.2%. In other words, it won't lose its momentum anytime soon. Costco remained a top shopping destination during the COVID-19 pandemic as consumers stocked up on essential products. The big spike in inflation from 2021 to 2023 also drove more cost-conscious consumers to its stores. It even raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years last September -- but that price hike didn't throttle its growth over the past year. That pricing power suggests it still has plenty of room to raise its membership fees in the future. Costco's gross margin dipped from 11.2% in fiscal 2020 to 10.9% in fiscal 2024. That pressure can be attributed to inflation , intentional limits on its markups, the expansion of its lower-margin e-commerce business, and currency headwinds for its overseas warehouses. However, its earnings per share ( EPS ) still grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% as its sales growth outpaced its gross margin compression, it raised its membership fees, and its scale diluted its operating expenses. What will happen to Costco over the next five years? From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Costco's net sales and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 8% and 10%, respectively. That stable growth should be driven by its plans to open 25 to 30 new warehouses per year, its ongoing investments in its e-commerce ecosystem , the expansion of its logistics network, and the stickiness of its ancillary services. However, Costco's stock isn't cheap at 52 times this year's earnings. At the beginning of calendar 2023, its forward price-to-earnings ratio was only in the low 30s. Therefore, a bit too much growth might be baked into its current valuations. If Costco matches Wall Street's estimates, grows its EPS by a CAGR of 10% over the following four years, and trades at a more reasonable 35 times forward earnings by the final year, its stock price could rise 20% to $1,140 by 2030. That would be a decent gain, but it probably won't come anywhere close to matching its returns from the past five years.",

    "artical_content": "The Motley Fool just updated its report on the world's largest consumer staples companies . Walmart ( WMT 0.88% ) tops the list by a wide margin, with a market cap of around $767 billion. It seems inevitable that the giant retailer will eventually grow its business in the future and achieve a trillion-dollar market cap. Here's what you need to know. What does Walmart do? Walmart is a retailer , just one of two that land on the largest consumer staples list. What's interesting is that Walmart and peer Costco Wholesale ( COST -0.23% ) are the top two companies on the list. But there are some big differences between these two industry-leading retailers. Image source: Getty Images. For starters, Walmart's market cap is over $350 billion higher than Costco's, which has a market cap of roughly $415 billion or so. The business models are also different, with Costco focused exclusively on operating club stores while Walmart operates club stores, grocery stores, and super stores. That diversification is important, because it gives Walmart more levers to pull as it looks to expand its business. Notably, Walmart and Costco both have a global reach, but Walmart's store format options allow it to spread its wings more widely. The best indication of Walmart's long-term success is found in its dividend history. The company has achieved the highly elite status of Dividend King , with more than five decades of annual dividend increases behind it. It clearly has a strong business model that it executed well in both good times and bad. That fact, plus the company's diversified global portfolio, suggests that slow and steady growth is reasonable to expect. But getting bigger for the sake of getting bigger isn't the goal. In fact, Walmart actually had more stores at the end of fiscal 2016 than it does today, roughly a decade later. The retailer is focused on growing profits as well as growing its business. It is clearly willing to do the hard work to make sure each of its locations is worth having, and closing those that are not. Helping the growth along here is inflation , which pushed both prices and, in turn, the retailer's sales, higher. Data by YCharts. Why does Walmart's market cap matter? Market cap is a simple math equation, multiplying a company's stock price by the number of shares it has outstanding. In the grand scheme of things, market cap isn't actually all that important for most companies. Tiny stocks can be highly risky, but once a certain scale is reached, market cap is less of an issue. Except that it does offer some bragging rights, like Walmart being able to claim that it is the largest consumer staples company on the planet. That said, tracking market cap can help investors determine if a company is growing or not. There's a market component to the metric, so the emotions of investors have to be taken into consideration. But a company that's getting larger and larger over time, based on market cap, is likely to be growing. That's exactly what Walmart has done for decades. And yet there is a grain of salt to consider, highlighting the huge price advance of the stock over the past year or so. In fact, for those who care about valuation along with size, Walmart stock looks a bit expensive right now. Its price-to-sales , price-to-earnings, and price-to-book-value ratios are all above their five-year averages. If valuation matters to you, this retail giant probably won't be a good fit for your portfolio. And there's a chance that the market cap could shrink if the stock price pulls back. Think long-term with Walmart Dividend King Walmart is not a flash-in-the-pan business; it has stood the test of time. And while it might be a bit expensive today, perhaps juicing its market cap a little bit, the company's business progress is likely to continue as reliably as it has in the past. Add in the impact of inflation, and it seems almost inevitable that Walmart will, someday, be a trillion-dollar business. While, given its valuation, you might not want to put it on your buy list today, it probably deserves a spot on your wish list. A deep pullback, perhaps during a bear market , could open up a great long-term buying opportunity in this steadily growing business.",

    "artical_content": "Signing up to shop at Costco Wholesale 's ( COST -0.23% ) stores is a lot like joining a club. You pay the dues and receive the benefits of membership in return. The company's primary rivals even call themselves clubs -- Walmart 's ( WMT 0.88% ) Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club ( BJ 0.92% ) . But there's an exclusive club that Costco isn't in right now that investors would love for it to join. Only 10 companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges have market caps of at least $1 trillion, enough to make them members of the trillion-dollar club . Is Costco on track to become a $1 trillion company? Image source: Costco Wholesale. An easy answer There's an easy answer to that question. Yes, Costco is on track to become a $1 trillion company. It's arguably more a matter of when and not if it will happen. Costco's market cap stood at $425 billion as of the market close on Aug. 26, 2025. The membership warehouse pioneer's valuation would need to increase by roughly 235% to reach $1 trillion. Is this growth feasible? Yep. The stock has delivered a slightly greater return over the last seven years. Most of this gain came in the last five years, with Costco's share price soaring more than 170%. Stock price appreciation tends to correlate with earnings growth over the long term. Costco's earnings per share jumped 13.2% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. If the company can continue to grow earnings at 13.2% per year and its share price moves higher at around the same rate, it could join the trillion-dollar club within the next seven years. How Costco could hit $1 trillion sooner rather than later Costco's market cap can reach $1 trillion sooner than seven years. Perhaps the easiest way for the company to boost revenue and earnings is to raise its membership fees. Costco last increased its membership fees in September 2024. The challenge with this option, though, is that higher fees could negatively affect renewal rates. Another option is for Costco to accelerate its international expansion. The company expects to have 285 stores outside the U.S. by the end of its fiscal year 2025. However, this will make up less than one-third of its total stores. Costco could also potentially move into new ancillary markets. A quick way to accomplish this would be to acquire one or more companies in high-margin industries. I'd say a no-brainer for Costco would be to step up its e-commerce game. Although the company's e-commerce sales are already growing faster than brick-and-mortar store sales, Costco lags well behind Walmart in serving customers online. Increasing operational efficiency through technology is another smart way for Costco to grow its bottom line. The company has some efforts underway along these lines, but it arguably hasn't been as adept at deploying technology as others in the consumer goods sector. Costco's biggest hurdles Costco has two primary hurdles to get to $1 trillion quickly. Neither is insurmountable, though, in my opinion. First, Costco faces stiff competition that could increase the difficulty in delivering stronger growth. The good news on this front is that the company's sales are growing faster than Sam's Club's and BJ's Wholesale Club's. Second, Costco's valuation might be problematic. The stock trades at a lofty forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46.5. Notably, though, high earnings multiples haven't kept Costco's share price from soaring in the past. Valuation won't necessarily be a significant issue going forward. I fully expect that Costco will indeed reach a market cap of $1 trillion by early in the next decade if not sooner. However, I view several other current members of the trillion-dollar club as even better picks for long-term investors.",

Electric Era Charging Station Network Goes Live to Ensure EV Drivers Get the Best Possible Charging Experience On the Road PR Newswire Wed, Aug 27, 2025, 11:40 AM 3 min read In this article: COST SEATTLE, Aug. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Electric Era's EV charging customers resoundingly love the company's new DC fast chargers. After all, their chargers enjoy a 96% positive PlugShare score from customers and with 90% session reliability and 98% per-port uptime – which makes their chargers among the most reliable in the industry. Electric Era EV charging fans post positive comments about why the love the new DC fast chargers on PlugShare. But for some, it can be tricky to find their favorite \"Electric Era\" brand charger out on the road. That's because their retail-focused chargers are wrapped in their customers' brand names like Costco Wholesale, Plaid Pantry and Skycharger, making them a little difficult for loyal charge fans to locate them as Electric Era Charging Stations. That's about to change as the company has launched the Electric Era Charging Station Network to make their charging locations visible on OEM vehicle mapping systems and discoverable on third-party platforms to help customers find their favorite high-power DC fast chargers. \"From the start, Electric Era's mission was to transform the EV charging industry by building the most reliable EV charging network in America. Now we're helping our retailer customers leverage reliability to build their brand affinity and customer loyalty programs to grow their business,\" said Electric Era founder and CEO Quincy Lee – a former SpaceX satellite engineer. The network is already available on PlugShare and Google Maps, and in the coming weeks will be available on Hubject and WEX fleet management platforms. Customers can find and save the Electric Era Charging Station Network in the filters section to quickly locate their chargers, regardless of the brand name on the kiosk. Because of their high reliability, Tesla already includes Electric Era chargers in its mapping systems under the Tesla Third Party Charging program. The network is also a bonus for Electric Era's retail-based customers who are tapping into Level-3 charging to attract new retail EV customers to grow their businesses as the network will help electric vehicle drivers find their locations. A Beacon of AssuranceIn an industry where reliability is king and a differentiator among charge providers, Electric Era assembled a team of former Starlink, Blue Origin, and Amazon Project Kuiper engineers to design reliability and remote serviceability into their chargers – which is critical if America's top retail brands are relying on their chargers to attract the growing numbers of affluent EV owners. \"When a satellite breaks down, we can't send a repairman up into space. So we used that same mindset when we designed our chargers by automating fault detection and over-the-air repairs,\" Lee said. \"That's why we're confident enough to financially back our chargers to deliver 98.5% or better per-port uptime.\" 繼續閱讀 Their customers have taken notice too, as nearly 70% of Electric Era charge users are repeat customers and many have taken to sites like PlugShare and Google Maps to share the praise. Most liked the ability to tap and pay without having to use a specialized app and the ease of using Electric Era chargers. Others applauded the high-speed 200 kW charging power capability and the dual CCS and NACS charging cables. With the Electric Era Charing Network up and running, more OEMs like Ford, Rivian and General Motors electric are expected to add the network to their in-car mapping systems so their customers can discover Electric Era chargers when traveling.

Don't miss Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it Before being laid off seven months ago, Tom earned $130,000 annually in commercial real estate credit risk. Now he’s an Uber driver, which he told The Ramsey Show, “isn’t too great” an income. His wife has a full-time job making $130,000 a year, but the couple worry about their financial future. Here’s more about Tom’s risky situation and what financial expert Dave Ramsey had to say. The whole story Tom and his wife pay $4,400 a month toward the $540,000 mortgage on their home. Meanwhile, they have three rental properties which are more income strain than income stream. On top of their principal residence, they pay a bundle in mortgage payments on their investment properties every month: $2,956 on Rental #1 $1,019 on Rental #2 $1,184 on Rental #3, which he purchased with a business partner. Read more: Do you own rental properties in the US? These 6 hacks can help you boost your income and lower your tax burden That doesn’t include property taxes or home insurances. The couple are behind on those, and owe $6,000 in property taxes and face $1,000 in forced insurance. Oh yeah, and they have a car loan and credit-card debt. The one bright spot is that they have $12,500 in emergency fund savings, but it can’t get them out of a hole this deep. In desperation, the couple are now ready to sell off all their assets: the car, home and three rental properties, including the one Tom bought with a business partner. Tom told Ramsey he was close to selling it. When Ramsey probed further, Tom revealed he was considering letting a buyer “take over” that mortgage. “So you haven't really sold the house. You just lease-purchased it to someone,” Ramsey said bluntly. “That's a bad deal.” Ramsey warned that could trigger the loan’s due-on-sale clause. Most mortgages come with a due-on-sale clause, which lets lenders call the entire loan due if you sell or transfer the property without their approval. 繼續閱讀 Ramsey says more debt means more risk “You went into all these properties thinking there was no risk and the tenants were going to pay everything,” Ramsey said. “And you found out the more debt there is, the more risk there is. And you just took on a boatload of risk for no money.” Ramsey said Tom was doing the right thing trying to sell all the assets and encouraged him to get a more reliable income stream with a full-time job. So how do you know when you’ve crossed the line from savvy investor to overleveraged landlord? Here’s what the experts and lenders say. Mortgage caps are real While TV house-flippers can make it look easy, the financing rules tell a different story. The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) allows borrowers to hold up to 10 financed properties as second homes and investment properties. SparkRental, a landlord resource, notes that most banks get nervous once you hold more than four conventional mortgages. At that point, you’ll need stronger credit scores, larger down payments, and hefty cash reserves just to qualify for the next loan. Follow the 28/36 rule When it comes to affordability, most lenders rely on a simple yardstick: the 28/36 debt-to-income rule, which says that no more than 28% of your gross monthly income should go toward housing (mortgages, insurance, taxes) and no more than 36% should cover all your debts combined — including car loans, student loans and credit cards. According to Bankrate, some loan programs stretch that ceiling to 43%, but investors playing it safe should stay well below. Now imagine your household income is cut in half, whether through divorce, job loss or illness. The same rule applies, only the limits are cut in half. Suddenly, multiple mortgages that once looked comfortable could push your debt ratio into red-alert territory. Don’t bank on every dollar of rent A common trap for landlords is thinking that rental income fully offsets your mortgages. In reality, lenders only count about 75% of projected rental income when calculating what you can afford. And under Fannie Mae’s selling guide, that income can only be used to offset each property’s own costs and not to boost your broader cash flow. Keep a cash cushion Mortgage underwriters don’t just check income. They also want to see reserves, and according to Fannie Mae, typically six months of payments per rental property isn’t unusual once you hit five or more financed homes. That safety net becomes even more critical if you’re suddenly covering mortgages without rental income to back them up. Owning rental properties can build wealth, but, as Ramsey advised Tom, the risks grow with every mortgage you add. If your income were cut in half tomorrow, could you keep every loan current? If not, it might be time to slow down, build reserves or consolidate before you stretch yourself past the point of no return. Tom’s story is a cautionary tale, but with realistic planning, risk awareness, and careful job hunting, it’s possible to get back on a solid financial footing.

The retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023, closing 360 stores before relaunching that June under new ownership. Overstock purchased its intellectual property and relaunched the company under The Brand House Collective. Now, Bed Bath and Beyond says a new Nashville location will serve as a test site for potential future stores. Don't miss Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it One place it will not return to is California. “California has created one of the most overregulated, expensive, and risky environments for businesses in America,” executive chairman Marcus Lemonis said in a statement. He pointed to what he described as “higher taxes, higher fees, higher wages.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office fired back on social media platform X: \"After their bankruptcy and closure of every store, like most Americans, we thought Bed Bath & Beyond no longer existed. We wish them well in their efforts to become relevant again as they try to open a 2nd store.\" California dreamin’ elsewhere Lemonis has long been critical of California’s business environment, saying it makes it harder to keep stores open and deliver value to customers. He emphasized that the retailer will still operate in “almost every other state.” While brick-and-mortar stores will not reopen in California, shoppers there can still make online purchases. To meet that demand, the company plans a dedicated “California strategy,” which includes same-day delivery in some areas and 24- to 48-hour shipping. Bed Bath & Beyond isn’t alone in pulling back. Between 2018 and 2021, more than 350 firms moved their headquarters out of California, according to research by Lee E. Ohanian of the Hoover Institution and Joseph Vranich, a Texas-based business relocation consultant. Many were lured away by lower taxes, lighter regulations and friendlier business climates.

These 6 hacks can help you boost your income and lower your tax burden What it means for shoppers and businesses The company is opening its first brick-and-mortar location since bankruptcy in Nashville under a slightly revised name: Bed Bath & Beyond Home. 繼續閱讀 Also looking beyond California was In-N-Out. CEO Lynsi Snyder made the move, expanding its burger chain outside the state by establishing a second headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee. \"There are a lot of great things about California, but raising a family is not easy here. Doing business is not easy here,\" Snyder said in a recent interview on the Relatable podcast. She also raised safety concerns. In 2024, In-N-Out shuttered its Oakland restaurant after 18 years, citing rising crime in the area, even though the location was still turning a profit. Bed Bath & Beyond has voiced similar frustrations, pointing to a rise in retail theft across the state over the past two years. A study by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found shoplifting increased in major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco between 2021 and 2022. In response, voters approved Proposition 36 last November, making repeat shoplifting offenses subject to felony charges. As companies weigh costs, regulations and safety, California’s business climate will remain under a microscope. New policies may address some of those challenges, but the bigger question is whether they’ll be enough to stop the outflow of retailers or if shoppers in the Golden State will have to get used to clicking “add to cart” instead of walking into a store.
