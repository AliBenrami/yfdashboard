    "artical_content": "Nvidia 's ( NVDA -3.38% ) CEO, Jensen Huang, has transformed his company into the world's largest by identifying trends earlier than anyone else. This is how Nvidia captured a significant portion of the AI computing market, delivering substantial gains to its shareholders. So, when Jensen Huang calls a company's stock a \"very smart buy,\" investors should listen up. What company was Huang talking about when he mentioned this? It's none other than a key Nvidia supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM -3.05% ) . Image source: Getty Images. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key Nvidia supplier During a visit to TSMC, Jensen Huang stated: Well, first of all, I think TSMC is one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity, and anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person. That's huge praise from the man who leads and founded the world's largest company. But is he right? Taiwan Semiconductor, widely known as TSMC, is in a strong and unique position in the chip world . It's a semiconductor foundry that produces chips for companies like Nvidia that lack the in-house capabilities to do it themselves. This fosters a strong working relationship, as they each depend on one another. Nvidia isn't the only company that uses TSMC; others, such as AMD ( AMD -3.52% ) and Apple ( AAPL -0.19% ) , do also. This raises a key point about TSMC: It often produces chips for companies that are competing against each other. AMD and Nvidia are vying for supremacy in AI computing power , and Apple's iPhones are competing against Google's Pixel phones, which have just started using TSMC-made chips. With TSMC remaining neutral and acting only as a supplier to companies battling it out, it's in a position to capitalize on several key trends without needing to develop the winning product. As long as TSMC can stay on top with the technology it offers, it will maintain its market leadership position. By the end of the year, TSMC's next chip node, the 2nm (nanometer) chip, will be in production. This chip offers substantially better power consumption (25% to 30% improvement) compared to the 3nm variety when configured at the same speed. While concern grows about the power consumption of AI data centers, this innovation is expected to be a massive hit among tech companies. Additionally, TSMC has 1.6nm and 1.4nm designs in the pipeline, which are expected to offer similar power consumption improvements. Clearly, TSMC is one of the world's most innovative companies, and the successes of many tech giants can be traced back to it. But is it a smart buy now? Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't have an expensive price tag Taiwan Semiconductor has put up jaw-dropping growth in recent quarters, with Q2's revenue rising 44% year over year in U.S. dollars. That makes it one of the fastest-growing big tech stocks, trailing only Nvidia. Despite that, the market hasn't placed a premium valuation on TSMC's stock, as it only trades for 24 times forward earnings . TSM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts Considering that the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC -0.64% ) trades for 23.7 times forward earnings, this indicates TSMC is valued about the same as an average S&P 500 stock . With its key position in the AI arms race, as well as its growth, I think this is a huge bargain. Therefore, Jensen Huang's statement about how smart people are buying TSMC stock is absolutely correct. I think Taiwan Semiconductor is one of the top AI stocks to buy now, as the AI arms race spending spree is still going strong.",

    "artical_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and \"on sale\" aren't two phrases that are normally used in the same sentence, but for some companies, I think it's true. The market has pulled back a bit since achieving all-time highs, and has opened up some buying opportunities on a few leading AI stocks. Two that I think provide excellent value for their upcoming growth are Alphabet ( GOOG 0.56% ) ( GOOGL 0.60% ) and Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM -3.05% ) . Both of these companies are leaders in their respective spaces and have a ton of AI tailwinds blowing in their favor. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Alphabet Alphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and the Android operating system. Its fingers are in many areas of technology, so it's no surprise it's pursuing AI heavily. While Alphabet was caught off guard by OpenAI and ChatGPT in the first few months of the AI arms race, that's no longer the case. Google Gemini is one of the leading generative AI models and is perhaps the most used version, thanks to its integration with AI search overviews in Google Search. However, most investors are still tied to the fact that they think Alphabet will be disrupted by AI, even though that hasn't come to fruition yet. Google Search's revenue rose by 12% in Q2, which isn't a sign of a struggling business. Furthermore, Google Cloud, its cloud computing business unit, continues to excel, signing major customers like its competitors OpenAI and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) to its platform. Revenue from Google Cloud rose 32% year-over-year, and it's slated to have a multi-year expansion thanks to massive tailwinds in the AI space and general computing workloads migrating to the cloud. Despite all of these positive tailwinds and excellent results, Alphabet's overall revenue increased by 14% and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose by 22% in Q2. However, Alphabet's stock still trades at a steep discount to the market and its peers. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts At 21 times forward earnings , Alphabet is cheaper than the broader stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) . The S&P 500 trades for 23.7 times forward earnings, which firmly places Alphabet in the value category. Alphabet is putting on a strong display of growth, yet trades for a steep discount. I think this makes Alphabet one of the best AI stocks to buy now, and investors should take advantage of this cheap price as soon as possible. 2. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor is one of the most, if not the most, important companies in the world. Its chip foundry services are used by many of the biggest names in tech, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . Few companies have in-house capabilities to produce chips, so they farm that work out to a company like Taiwan Semiconductor. Taiwan Semi has established itself at the top of the chip fabrication industry by continuously innovating and offering the best technology while also delivering strong chip yields, which helps keep pricing low. This gives TSMC an advantage over other major chip fabricators, and easily gives it the top dog position in this industry. Without Taiwan Semiconductor's capabilities, the AI arms race would look a lot different. However, because it's at the center of providing computing power to fuel the arms race, it makes for an excellent investment. While it's not as cheap as Alphabet, it's still reasonably priced at 23.9 times forward earnings, placing its valuation in line with the S&P 500. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts However, it's putting up impressive growth, delivering 44% revenue growth in U.S. dollars during Q2. Management is bullish on the long-term trajectory of AI-related chips and believes this multi-year trend will power the stock to new heights over the next few years. Although Taiwan Semi isn't cheaper than the market, its growth indicates it should have a massive premium to the market. As a result, I think the stock looks cheap compared to its growth rate, making it a no-brainer buy right now.",

    "artical_content": "Earnings season -- the six-week period where many of the S&P 500 's components report their operating results -- is often viewed as the most important data dump every quarter. But don't overlook the invaluable information provided by Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F is a quarterly filing that shows investors which stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and select options Wall Street's genius fund managers have been buying and selling. Though 13Fs aren't without their flaws (e.g., they may contain stale information for active hedge funds), they can clue investors into the stocks and trends that are intriguing successful money managers. While Warren Buffett tends to be the most-followed of all billionaire asset managers , he's not the only one with a lengthy track record of spotting good deals hiding in plain sight. Third Point's billionaire investor Dan Loeb is another money manager who rightly garners attention. Image source: Getty Images. What's made Loeb such an interesting fund manager to follow is his penchant for investing in large- and small-cap growth stocks, as well as his lure to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Based on 13Fs, Loeb has been a decisive seller of world-leading chip fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM -3.05% ) , which is more commonly known as \"TSMC,\" over the last year. But he's also done quite a bit of buying in the AI arena, with another trillion-dollar AI stock on the menu. Billionaire Dan Loeb has been sending shares of TSMC to the chopping block Though examining share purchases and sales over the prior three-month period can be informative, looking back six or 12 months can help investors spot patterns. Third Point's last four 13Fs show that billionaire Dan Loeb has been a clear seller of TSMC stock. Between the end of June 2024 and the midpoint of 2025, Loeb has sent 595,000 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to the chopping block, which reduced his fund's stake in the company by 29%. The 1.43 million shares still held makes TSMC Third Point's fifth-largest holding by market value. One of the likeliest reasons for selling TSMC stock is simple profit-taking. From the start of May 2024 through the midpoint of 2025, Taiwan Semiconductor stock rallied about 65%. Loeb upped his fund's position in TSMC notably during the second quarter of 2024. With the average hold time of Third Point's top-10 positions clocking in at roughly 11 months, it's not surprising to see Loeb actively locking in gains. However, there may be more at play than just a desire to take profits. For example, TSMC is valued at nearly 22 times forward-year earnings. Though a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22 is actually quite reasonable when compared to other market-leading AI stocks, it's a premium compared to the forward P/Es of 13, 16, and 20 that TSMC ended the year with in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. The perceived bargain that Loeb nabbed isn't as apparent in the forward P/E ratio any longer. It's also possible that Loeb has concerns about TSMC's outlays to expand its manufacturing presence in the U.S. Among the reasons the company is expanding production in the U.S. is to avoid tariffs from the Donald Trump administration . The cost to build and expand U.S. chip-manufacturing facilities, coupled with potentially higher production costs and lead times, has the potential to weigh on TSMC's operating results. Nevertheless, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing appears to be ideally positioned to benefit from the AI revolution . Even if there are demand hiccups, its lengthy backlog and revenue diversity – it's a leading provider of chips for next-generation smartphones, automobiles, and internet of Things devices -- set the company up for long-term success. Image source: Getty Images. Dan Loeb made this trillion-dollar AI stock a top-three holding over the last two quarters On the other end of the spectrum, Third Point's Dan Loeb entered 2025 with no shares of Wall Street's largest public company and the leader of the artificial intelligence revolution, Nvidia ( NVDA -3.38% ) . But during the first and second quarters, he oversaw the purchase of 1.45 million and 1.35 million shares of Nvidia, respectively. Loeb's fund now owns 2.8 million shares of this trillion-dollar colossus of a company, and it's grown into his fund's third-largest holding. For more than two years, the lure for investors with Nvidia has been its AI- graphics processing unit (GPU) dominance. The company's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell GPUs dominate in AI-accelerated data centers, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noting that \"demand is extraordinary\" for Blackwell Ultra (the successor to the Blackwell chip). No other competitors have come close to matching the compute capabilities of Nvidia's AI hardware. Huang is attempting to bring a new advanced chip to market on an annual basis . The ramp up of Blackwell Ultra is ongoing, with the debut of Vera Rubin and Vera Rubin Ultra expected in the second-halves of 2026 and 2027, respectively. The latter two will run on the all-new Vera processor and should help solidify Nvidia's position atop the compute pedestal. Loeb likely also appreciates the role Nvidia's CUDA platform has played in delivering eye-popping sales and profit growth. CUDA is the toolkit developers lean on to get the most out of their Nvidia GPUs, including the building and training of large language models . It's effectively become the anchor that keeps clients loyal to Nvidia's ecosystem of products. The other catalyst that may have enticed Loeb to nearly double Third Point's stake in Nvidia during the second quarter was the early April swoon for Wall Street . President Trump's tariff announcements on April 2 led to a short-lived mini-crash in the major stock indexes. This allowed opportunistic investors, including billionaire money managers, to go shopping. But continued upside in Nvidia is far from a guarantee. History tells us that every next-big-thing trend for more than 30 years has endured a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. Investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the early stage utility and adoption rate of new technologies, which eventually leads to sky-high expectations not being met. This same fate seems likely for the artificial intelligence revolution. Competitive pressures should eventually weigh on Nvidia , as well. In particular, having many of its top customers by net sales developing their own AI-GPUs could cost it valuable real estate in data centers, or at the very least may delay future upgrade cycles.",
